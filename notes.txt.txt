  AI-BASED STUDENT PERFORMANCE PREDICTION SYSTEM

Introduction:

AI Based student performance prediction system predict the students performance using machine learning models based on the given factors such as:
Attendance
Internal Marks
Study hours
Assignments completion

Application:

This helps students to identify the risk and supports early intervention.

-----------------------------------------
Dataset Design:

The dataset will include the following input features:

1. attendance – Percentage of classes attended (0–100)
2. internal_marks – Internal exam score (0–50)
3. study_hours – Average weekly study hours (0–6)
4. assignments – Assignment completion percentage (0–100)

Target Variable:
5. performance – Final student outcome (Pass/Fail)

Reason for selecting these features:
These parameters represent student academic behavior, consistency, and preparation level. They are strong indicators of academic performance and help the ML model identify students at risk.
